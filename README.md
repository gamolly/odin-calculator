# odin-calculator
To create a calculator that calculates things that need to be calculated.
I am not focusing on the CSS/styling in this exercise, at the moment. 

Note 2022/12/26: I have the pseudocode to be able to perform multiple operations following PEDMAS. 
I may come back at a later time and implement it. I also may come back to make it look pretty.
